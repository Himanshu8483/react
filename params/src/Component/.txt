redux is a  library
rtk redux toolkit
redux toolkit is used to resolve the boundation of accessing data from parent to child so data can be globaly accessed throughout anywehere.
react-redux, readux-toolkit two libraries install,

ex. add to cart
button click(add): action Dispatch ==> function exicute (reducer) to write ==> storing in store 
store is just like an object 
so make slices in store for arrange differentiate data in an ordarly format rather than miscellanious data altogeather.
so user can fetch particular type of data 
"write"
slice can be array or object 
via reducer we modify slice

then for reading data from store use selector(read).

step:
library install 
npm i react-redux for bridge from component fto store
npm i @reduxjs/toolkit  for providing slice, ..
build store(if store is building slicing will required in store)  & create slice
Action Dispatch
selector
