slice and types with all thing revise 

redux is a  library
rtk redux toolkit 
redux toolkit is used to resolve the boundation of accessing data from parent to child so data can be globaly accessed throughout anywehere.
react-redux, readux-toolkit two libraries install,

ex. add to cart
button click(add): action Dispatch ==> function exicute (reducer) to write ==> storing in store 
store is just like an object 
so make slices in store for arrange differentiate data in an ordarly format rather than miscellanious data altogeather.
so user can fetch particular type of data 
"write"
slice can be array or object 
via reducer we modify slice

then for reading data from store use selector(read).

step:
library install 
npm i react-redux for bridge from component fto store
npm i @reduxjs/toolkit  for providing slice, ..
build store(if store is building slicing will required in store)  & create slice
Action Dispatch
selector 

**Redux Toolkit (RTK) Guide**

Redux Toolkit (RTK) is a library designed to simplify state management in React applications. It resolves the limitations of accessing data from parent to child components by making data globally accessible throughout the application. It provides tools to efficiently manage, update, and read the application state.

### **Key Concepts in Redux**

1. **Store:**
    - Centralized storage for state management.
    - Think of it like a single object holding the entire application state.

2. **Slices:**
    - A slice is a part of the store that contains related state, actions, and reducers.
    - Helps organize data logically.

3. **Actions:**
    - Plain JavaScript objects that describe an intention to change state.

4. **Reducers:**
    - Functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to an action.

5. **Dispatch:**
    - A method used to send actions to reducers to update the state.

6. **Selectors:**
    - Functions that read and retrieve specific data from the store.

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Using Redux Toolkit**

1. **Install Libraries:**
    ```bash
    npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
    ```
    - `@reduxjs/toolkit`: Provides state management features like slices and reducers.
    - `react-redux`: Acts as a bridge between React components and the Redux store.

2. **Create Store:**
    ```javascript
    import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
    import cartSlice from './cartSlice';

    const store = configureStore({
      reducer: {
        cart: cartSlice,
      },
    });

    export default store;
    ```

3. **Create a Slice:**
    ```javascript
    import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

    const cartSlice = createSlice({
      name: 'cart',
      initialState: [],
      reducers: {
        addToCart: (state, action) => {
          state.push(action.payload);
        },
        removeFromCart: (state, action) => {
          return state.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload.id);
        },
      },
    });

    export const { addToCart, removeFromCart } = cartSlice.actions;
    export default cartSlice.reducer;
    ```

4. **Provide Store to App(in main.jsx):**
    ```javascript
    import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
    import store from './store';

  <StrictMode>
    <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
    </Provider>
  </StrictMode>,
    ```

5. **Dispatch Actions:**
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
    import { addToCart } from './cartSlice';

    const Product = ({ product }) => {
      const dispatch = useDispatch();

      const handleAddToCart = () => {
        dispatch(addToCart(product));
      };

      return <button onClick={handleAddToCart}>Add to Cart</button>;
    };

    export default Product;
    ```

6. **Read Data Using Selectors:**
    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';
    import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

    const Cart = () => {
      const cart = useSelector((state) => state.cart);

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Cart Items</h2>
          {cart.map((item, index) => (
            <div key={index}>{item.name}</div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default Cart;
    ```

### **Summary**
- **Install Libraries:** `npm install react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit`
- **Create a Store** using `configureStore()`
- **Create Slices** using `createSlice()`
- **Dispatch Actions** using `dispatch()`
- **Read Data** using `useSelector()`
